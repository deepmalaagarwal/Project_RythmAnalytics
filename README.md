Project_RythmAnalytics

Music business is constantly getting more and more data driven. The growth of streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music has really accelerated that change. Most executives now understand the value in analyzing user behavior and adapting strategies based on those metrics. In this project, we will read music dataset, analyze and visualize them using a Python Flask–powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS. This will be a dashboard application deployed Heroku server with multiple charts that would help us derive sales trends and insights using Music data
